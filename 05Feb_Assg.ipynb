    "Ans- __init__ is a special method in python which will execute whenever the object of that class is created.\n",
    "__init__ function is used to initialise the attributes of the class.\n",

    "Q-4.  Why self is used in OOPs ?\n",
    "Ans- self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "The reason we need to use self is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on.\n",
    "self is always pointing to the current object."
